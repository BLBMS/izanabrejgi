                            <h2>Description</h2>
                            <p>Return to the times of your grandparents in a cosy little house in a peaceful location
                                among the vineyards - but in a modern way, with all the comfort of today.</p>

                            <p>Fall asleep in silence under the moonlight and wake up to the singing of birds.</p>

                            <p>You can enjoy nature in your own yard, explore the surroundings on foot or by bike along
                                marked trails, or relax in the nearby thermal spas.</p>

                            <p>The translation from the local Prekmurje dialect is “House on the Hill”. The word grič
                                (“hill”)
                                is not used locally; instead, people use breg, which also means a hill, or the dialect
                                version brejg.
                                For the inhabitants of Spodnje Moravce (the lower part of today's Moravske Toplice), the
                                first
                                elevation behind the village was mainly used for vineyards. The flatter areas near the
                                farms
                                were used as agricultural land.</p>

                            <p>The first mention of the house dates back to 1864, and it is already marked on the
                                earliest maps.
                                The original purpose of the building was a viničarija - a vintner's house where workers
                                and their
                                families lived while taking care of the vineyards. The vineyards and the buildings were
                                owned by
                                the wealthier farmers from the lower part of the village.</p>

                            <p>The house is furnished with restored period furniture, and many pieces are more than 100
                                years old.</p>

                            <p>We have made an effort to take you on a journey into the past - to allow you to take time
                                for yourself
                                and your loved ones, and perhaps to reflect on the old values that are increasingly
                                disappearing in
                                today's fast-paced world.</p>

                            <p>Please use the house and furniture with care, so that we can pass them on to our
                                grandchildren and
                                great-grandchildren in the same condition in which they were handed down to us.</p>
